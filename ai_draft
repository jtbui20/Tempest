state machine - two set, full committment execution
  - stalk :

      - on shoot -> shield / dash (distance)
      - on update -> circular positioning / fixed loci
      - on dash -> dash output
  - strike :
    - condition: random
      - position to target radius
      - on mini target radius -> start combo
